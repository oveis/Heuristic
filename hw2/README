Euler circle and greedy TSP
1) I uploaded two euler_circuit_test_file:
  "euler_circuit_test_input" and "2euler_circuit_test_input"
2) They are just list of edges (only showing one direction)
3) Make sure the vertices are named as indexes, which means
   each vertex is a number between 0 and (numOfVertices - 1)
Compile: make
run: ./euler_circuit_test $(euler_circuit_test_file) $(start vertex)
